I'm a second year graduate student at Rutgers University in the [Computational Biology and Molecular Biophysics](http://www.biomaps.rutgers.edu/) program studying the physics of DNA and protein interactions. I plan on using this blog to show off cool algorithms and useful pieces of code I devise as a graduate student.

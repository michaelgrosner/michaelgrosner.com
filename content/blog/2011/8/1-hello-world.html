So this is my first post as a test. My name is Michael Grosner, I'm a second year graduate student at Rutgers University in the Computational Biology and Molecular Biophysics program specifically studying the physics of DNA and protein interactions. I plan on using this blog to show off cool algorithms and useful pieces of code I devise as a graduate student.

This blog is statically generated by the new Python "framework", Hyde. I mention framework in quotes since Hyde can be thought of more as a compiler than an interactive framework, it pieces together Jinja templates, Markdown, ReStructured Text or whatever else through Python to create easy-to-manage static sites.

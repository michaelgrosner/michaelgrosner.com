I initially wanted to share the results of my graduate fellowship applications because there are few publically available copies to judge chances and styles. I ended up not getting either of the fellowships I applied for. I attribute it to my lack of previously published work... Which should change in the next few weeks.

My resume/CV is elsewhere on the site, my application essays are listed below, and the NSF's grading report is also attached.

I present [CoffeeMol](http://www.michaelgrosner.com/coffeemol) (check out the [Source](https://github.com/michaelgrosner/CoffeeMol)), an embeddable, customizable, interactive ([try this out!](javascript:window.ctx.changeInfoFromSelectors('0', 'drawMethod', 'lines'))) JavaScript Molecular Visualizer for HTML5 Browsers written in CoffeeScript and jQuery. CoffeeMol offers the ability to view and manipulate molecular structures in any modern, standards compliant browser -- including many mobile devices. 

CoffeeMol was developed by myself while implementing a web interface for some simulated structures I needed in my grad school work. It doesn't require crazy PyMol hacks, use of in-browser Java like JMol, and can be used on nearly every modern web device.

### To embed into an existing webpage

This will reproduce the viewer above, except the viewer above only contains the first PDB file in `structures` and the CSS styles are different.

* Compile -- You'll need to install [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/#installation), or copy the compiled JS [here](http://www.michaelgrosner.com/CoffeeMol.js)

{% syntax bash %}
$ coffee -cj CoffeeMol.coffee CanvasContext.coffee Element.coffee Structure.coffee \
        Chain.coffee Residue.coffee Atom.coffee main.coffee Viewer.coffee	
{% endsyntax %}

* Create a `<canvas>` element with id `coffeemolCanvas`, include at least jQuery version 1.7.1, and the compiled `CoffeeMol.js` file.

{% syntax html %}
<canvas height="300" width="300" id="coffeemolCanvas">Canvas Load Failed</canvas>
...
</body>
<script src="jquery-1.7.1.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="CoffeeMol.js"  type="text/javascript"></script>
{% endsyntax %}

* Include the following JavaScript:

{% syntax javascript %}
// Change this dictionary to suit your PDB needs
structures = {
    "http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/files/1MBO.pdb": {  // URL to a well-behaved PDB file
        drawMethod: "both",                      // Use 'lines', 'points', 'cartoon' or 'both'
        drawColor: [255, 0, 0]                   // RGB color (optional)
    },
    "/static/pdbs/1KX5.pdb": {                   // Can mix structures and properties
        drawMethod: "points"
        borderColor: [100, 0, 0]
    }
};

// CoffeeMol only exposes the CanvasContext object to `window` and a loader function
ctx = window.ctx;
window.loadFromDict(structures);

// Once everything is loaded, run it
ctx.init();
{% endsyntax %}

### To use the full, interactive mode

Go to the [CoffeeMol Interactive Viewer](http://www.michaelgrosner.com/coffeemol)

### Structure Options

* `drawMethod` - Choose one of the following options
    * `points` - Draw each atom as a ball, colored by element type if no `drawColor` is provided
    * `lines` - Draw as bonds between atoms.
    * `cartoon` - Draw "bonds" between C-alpha atoms in protein and along DNA Phosphate backbone. Much quicker rendering than other methods.
    * `both` - Draw `points` on top of `bonds`. Visually pleasing, computationally intensive.
* `drawColor` - Provide a length 3 array or a string of the form `#XXXXXX` corresponding to RGB values
* `borderColor` - Atoms in `points` have a thin border around each atom. Change this color.

### Known Issues

This is pre-alpha software, there are probably many unknown issues in additiion to these

* Very slow on iOS and slow with larger structures
* Only tested on the latest Chrome, Firefox, and Safari versions as of 1/26/12 on a Mac running Lion
* Rotation speed is bounded due to roundoff error? Bad math?
* Synchronous AJAX requests only work, i.e. `$.ajax` with `async: true`
* Highly unoptimized

And enjoy! (And send bug reports/feature requests via Github!)

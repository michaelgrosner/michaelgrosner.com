All Python developers should be well aware of [IPython](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/) and its awesome [Notebook](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html) functionality. It's like Mathematica, but runs Python underneath. Probably the most mature open-source and free Python compatible cheminformatics software is [OpenBabel](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html), which supports SVG drawing of molecular structures from SMILES or nearly any other format.

In my work this summer computationally manipulating chemical structures this summer, an indispensible method for visualizing complex molecular structures has been the following short function:

{% syntax python %}
from IPython.core.display import SVG
import openbabel, pybel
import subprocess

def draw(can_smiles):
    cmd = 'obabel -:"%s" -ican -osvg' % can_smiles
    svg = subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True)
    return SVG(data=svg)
{% endsyntax %}

An example is...
